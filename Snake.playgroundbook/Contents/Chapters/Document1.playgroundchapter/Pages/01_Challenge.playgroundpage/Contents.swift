 Here you see the end result, the game Snake 🐍
 
 Tap on "Run My Code" and swipe up, down, right or left to change the direction of the Snake.
 The goal is to eat as many yellow boxes (coins) as possible to become huge. Avoid to collide with the boundaries and also with the snake itself.
 Play around to get a feeling for what you will create, step by step, on the next pages.
 
 For best experience turn sound on 🔈
 
 After you finished your experiment start with your first challenge.
